    <title>Why I didnt read "Shepherd"</title>
    <shortdesc>Terry Pratchett quotes not only for Dummies</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Just shortly after Terry Pratchett died, his last book "Shepherd" was published. I have never read it. Why? I just wanted to have one of his novels ready to read on my shelf and I knew he will never write any sentence more.</p>
